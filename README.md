## About The Project
Interested in traveling the world, but having trouble organizing your trips? Travel Tracker will not only record and display your past, pending, and upcoming trips, but it will also allow you to request a new trip to be reviewed by one of its trusted travel agents! This password-protected site also keeps track of how much you've spent during the current year on travel, so you know where you stand financially as you consider your next destination.

This solo project was assigned at the end of the second module of Turing's Front-End Engineering program, about 11-12 weeks into its students learning how to code. The details of this project are outlined in <a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html">this</a> project spec.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create travel agent interaction
- [ ] Utilize DELETE network request via travel agent interaction

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Features

- Utilizes class-to-class interaction and a robust Mocha and Chai testing suite
- Implements both GET and POST network requests via fetch API to retrieve, display, and add new user data
- Handles both network request- and user-errors

### Reflections
<b>Wins:</b><br>
Although I worked with asynchronous JavaScript during this module's group project, I feel this solo project solidified my understanding of it. This project also allowed me time to dedicate to better understanding error-handling, and I feel I've a firmer grasp on handling both network request and user generated errors for it!
<p>
<b>Challenges:</b><br>
While I can see significant improvement in my ability to connect data and write dynamic code, I still feel there is some unnecessary repetition in my script and, therefore, I know that there is a cleaner/more dynamic solution to connect these data.
